                // (0 for at the middle, 1 for at the top) and multiplies it by public float speed scaler. We add 1 so camera
                // speed doesn't drop to zero at transition.

// by balancing the the ratio of speed to speed scaler I think the right feel can be acheived, its nice and smooth anyway. Note: max camera speed =~ speed*speedscaler.
